We create a Financial Literacy website for college students, to teach them and give them Financial education. Because financially illiterate can lead to a number of pitfalls, such as being more likely to accumulate unsustainable debt burdens, either through poor spending decisions or a lack of long-term preparation. This in turn can lead to poor credit, bankruptcy, housing foreclosure, and other negative consequences.

## DOCUMENTATION

### PROBLEM STATEMENT: - 
There are lot of problems faced by the college students and other people due to financial illiteracy in India so we are going to create a website which teaches the fundamental rules and terms of financial literacy, and how it can help college students in their life.

### REQUIREMENTS: - 
Hardware required- Computer
Software required- Web browser (Microsoft edge, chrome, etc.) and Visual Studio Code 

### Technologies Used: - 
Programming Languages used- HTML, CSS, Java Script.
Front-end framework- Bootstrap 

### Project Description: - 
We created a Financial Literacy website for college students, to teach them and give them financial education. Because financially illiterate can lead to a number of pitfalls, such as being more likely to accumulate unsustainable debt burdens, either through poor spending decisions or a lack of long-term preparation. This in turn can lead to poor credit, bankruptcy, housing foreclosure, and other negative consequences.
So, we started from designing a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and we also take help from the Bootstrap framework, and then we study about the financial education terms and fundamentals. After this we compile all things together and upload it on GitHub.  

### Scope: -
As one can imagine, the scope of financial literacy is vast. It encompasses budgetary education (personal or family budget) and learning about banking tools (everyday banking, savings, insurance), as well as understanding economic concepts (how the economy operates and is financed) and public policies.
Financial literacy is now among the growing concerns of the authorities at both national and international level. With the G20 advocating for it as one of eight core competencies, it is considered essential to protecting and improving oneâ€™s financial well-being.
This website will teach you the principles, fundamentals and important of financial literacy.

### Challenges Faced: -
We faced challenge in collecting the right and legitimate information on the subject, and alco compiling it together so it could be easy to understand by everyone.

### Conclusion: -
This website will teach you the principles, fundamentals and important of financial literacy, which will help students in their further life and it concluded that we are not taught financial literacy in school. It takes a lot of work and time to change our thinking and to become financially literate.
